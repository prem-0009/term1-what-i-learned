1. Array.isArray()<br>
-This method  is used to check if the passed value is an array
2. Change a string to an array<br>
* `string.split()` can be used to change a string into an array
3. Asynchronous Vs synchronous code.
* when a code goes step by step, it is a synchronous code.
* When a code does not go step by step, it is an asynchronous code. Some code need to be run only after certain time, that is when we use this process.

4. console.clear()<br>
* It clears the screen off previous content.

5. csv files.
* csv is comma separated value file.
* We can  import data from this types of files and write code to get the data we want from big pool of data.
* csv file are separated by comma and new line.
* > To be able to use it ,we do:
  > split the file by new lines. This gives us one big array.
  > then, split it again with ',' and now we get 2d array.
  > Now we can write code to get whichever value we want with ease.

6. Comparing two different arrays.
* arr[2,3] === arr1[2,3] is false.
* Arrays are like boxes, they can look alike but they are not one box.
