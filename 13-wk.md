covered: Flexbox , grid and media.
1. HTML semantics.<br>
   HTML semantics are tags made for easy reading.<br>
   For ex: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`,`<figure>` etc

2. Flexbox.<br>
   It is the way of providing a space to tags/selectors.<br>
   Some selectors can be provided more space.<br>
   Features:<br>
   1. The direction of the boxes, if it is going down as a column or going in horizontal as a row.
   2. The spacing between selectors, if they need equal spacing or don't need any spacing.
   3. Aligning the child-items inside the parent-box. If the items are put in the center or stretched out to fit in the box.
   

3. Grid. <br>
   Grid is the way to assemble the layout in 2d.<br>
   ```
   selectors {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: 20% 30% 30% 20% or 1fr 2fr 2fr ;
       grid-template-rows: 40% 20% auto;
   }
   ```

4. @media <br>
    ```
    @media (mid-width:900px) {

       
    }
    ```
    1. @media is used to specify the size of display where we'll be applying the rule of css <br>
    2. It is generally a good idea to start with mobile display to the medium and bigger display at the end.
   
5. vh and vw.<br>
   vh and vw are percentage of display a grid or a box will be occupying within a parent selector.
