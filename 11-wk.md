1. __dirname
* dunder dirname
* ex. `const file = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/../folder/filename.json', 'utf-8') `
* Whenever working with multiple numbers of files `__dirname` is a useful to link to the required file.
* the file has to be place not on the same folder, but one up folder.

2. ls *
* It is a command that displays all the folders and files inside them.

3. tree
* It works in a same way as `ls *` excepts it add visual tree-branch features.

4. ```
   const data = {
            todos: globalTodos,
            }
    const globalTodos = [{},{},{}];
    ```
    * todos here acts as a variable where value can be assigned.

5. creating `array.unshift()` method.
   * original array = [3, 5, 8]
   * adding 6 so the new array will be =[6, 3, 5, 8]
   * pseudocode
     * loop through the original array with<br> `let i = arr.length; i > 0 ;i-- ` instead of `let i = 0`.
     * assign the new array `arr[i] = arr[i-1]` which means <br>
        `arr[3] = arr[3-1]` = 8, <br>
        `arr[2] = arr[2-1]` = 5, <br>
        `arr[1] = arr[1-1]` = 3, <br>
        with `i > 0` the loop will now end.
      * assing `arr[0] = the give value`.
6. creating `array.shift()` method.
   * with shift we can remove the first elements of an array.
   * original array = [2, 5, 8].
   * removing 2, so the new array will be = [5, 8].
   * pseudocode 
     * loop through the original array.
     * assign the new array `arr[i] = arr[i + 1]` which means,<br>
        `arr[0] = arr[0 + 1]` = 5,<br>
        `arr[1] = arr[1 + 1]` = 8,
     * then we return previous arr[i] which is 2.
